# Creeper Tweaks

**Creeper Tweaks** is a server-side Fabric mod that adds various tweaks and improvements to Creepers in Minecraft.

## Features

### ✂️ Creeper Shearing (Defusing)
You can now use **Shears** on a Creeper to defuse it!
- **Right-click** a Creeper with Shears.
- The Creeper will drop **Gunpowder**.
- The Creeper becomes a **Dud**: it will still hiss and swell, but it **cannot explode**.
- Useful for farming gunpowder or making safe pets!

### 🎉 Confetti Creepers
Some creepers might just want to party!
- Configurable chance for creepers to "explode" into **confetti** (particles/sound) instead of destroying blocks.
- No damage, no griefing, just fun!

### ♻️ Eco-Friendly Creepers
Tired of creeper holes?
- Enable **Eco-Friendly Mode** to ensure creepers drop **100% of the blocks** they destroy.
- Makes cleaning up craters much easier as you get all your materials back.
- Configurable per-creeper type chance.

### 🧟 Custom Creeper Types
The mod introduces several new creeper variants that can spawn naturally:
- **Baby Creepers**: Small, fast, and adorable (but deadly!).
- **Charged Creepers**: Naturally spawning charged creepers.
- **Baby Charged Creepers**: A terrifying combination.
- **Titan Creepers**: Giant, slow, tough, with a massive explosion radius.
- **Silent Creepers**: Rare creepers that make no sound before exploding!

## Configuration
The mod is highly configurable via `config/creepertweaks.toml`. You can adjust:
- Global features (Shearing, Confetti, Eco-Friendly).
- Custom creeper types (spawn rates, health, speed, explosion radius, scale).
- Define your own creeper variants!

## Installation
1. Download the `.jar` file.
2. Place it in your server's `mods` folder.
3. (Optional) Configure settings in `config/creepertweaks.toml`.
